+ I perform freelance work through graphics design, websites, application tools, and video game servers.

+ I take great pride in my work ethic as it has and will carry over into any task that I take on.

+ I actively build and manage Darkwater Entertainment, a video game server community with 275+ members where I actively create and develop websites, graphics, applications, and video game servers for personal gain.

PROGRAMMING COMPETENCIES: C++, C#, HTML, CSS, Lua, Java, Python

I love to watch and play various sports and develop close relations with people. I get excited about opportunities to help others grow! I'm always looking to make new connections, so feel free to send me a note so that we can start talking!
