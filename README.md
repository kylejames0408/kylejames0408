Hello!

My name is Kyle James. I'm a fifth-year BS/MS student at the Rochester Institute of Technology studying Game Design and Development. I am actively seeking to work in the video game industry. In the meantime, I'm honing my skills to carry me forward.

+ Everybody has a story to tell. I seek to tell my stories through video games and video game design.

+ My passion is designing, developing, and producing video games that tell a story while finding the fun in the mechanics.

+ I helped bring the world of ChangelingVR to life and created a lasting structure for project management moving forward. 

+ I recently started working on my video game design capstone for my Master's degree.

+ I take great pride in my work ethic as it has and will carry over into any task that I take on.

+ I actively built and managed Darkwater Entertainment, a video game server community with 300+ members, where I created and developed websites, graphics, applications, and video game servers for personal gain.

I love to watch and play various sports and develop close relations with people. I get excited about opportunities to help others grow! I'm always looking to make new connections, so feel free to send me a note so we can start talking!
